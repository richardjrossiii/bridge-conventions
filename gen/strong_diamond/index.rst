.. _Responding to 1C:

------------------------------------------
Responding to a 1\ :club-suit:`C` opening:
------------------------------------------

Welcome to the thunderdome. 

1\ :club-suit:`C` can generally be considered a 'catch all' bid in the system; designed for hands that have:
  - Are 11-13 HCP; balanced
  - Have no 5 card major
  - Have a minor as a primary suit

Because so many hand shapes could exist here; any intermediate hand with 5+ \ :club-suit:`C` and 5+ \ :diamond-suit:`D` will bid 2\ :club-suit:`C`; instead. 
This makes a lot of our relay sequences later much more trivial.

It's best to treat 1\ :club-suit:`C` as semiforcing. As no *extremely* strong hands exist behind this bid; it can often be correct to pass with a weak hand and good tolerance (4+) for clubs.

Be aware that partner may still have a very strong two-suited hand; below the 1D threshold.

Responders goals change slightly depending on whether we are at MPs or IMPs. But in general:

Weak Hands
----------

Weak hands with a 6 card suit should nearly always attempt to follow their drop sequence - even if they have another side 4 card suit:
  - \ :club-suit:`C`: 1\ :club-suit:`C` - P - 1\ :spade-suit:`S` - 1NT - 2\ :club-suit:`C`
  - \ :diamond-suit:`D`: 1\ :club-suit:`C` - P - 1\ :spade-suit:`S` - 1NT - 2\ :club-suit:`C`
  - \ :heart-suit:`H`: 1\ :club-suit:`C` - P - 1\ :diamond-suit:`D` - ? - 2\ :heart-suit:`H`
  - \ :spade-suit:`S`: 1\ :club-suit:`C` - P - 1\ :heart-suit:`H` - ? - 2\ :spade-suit:`S`

In general; hands with a 6 card suit should not attempt to play at the one level (even in clubs - partner may give you a response that significantly improves your hand).

Weak hands with a single 5 card suit often have a tougher decision to make. 

When that 5 card suit is a major; transfering to it *nearly always* gets us to the correct par-score. 

With a 5 card minor and no other mitigating factors; generally trying to drop partner in 1NT is the correct call, as we don't have the space to determine partners minor distribution (they can still have a void in clubs).

Weak hands with a single 4 card major should strongly consider passing partner in 1\ :heart-suit:`H`/\ :spade-suit:`S` if the opportunity arises.

With equal length in the majors; hands start by transfering to hearts. 

If partner responds 1\ :heart-suit:`H`; we can ask for spade support as well by bidding 1\ :spade-suit:`S` (forcing 1 round). From there; we generally have a good grasp on the correct place to land the contract. 

When opener responds 1NT; we comfortably pass with 4/4; and with 5/5 we now have the confidence to safely bid 2\ :spade-suit:`S` (non forcing), as there is precisely one shape with a 2 card spade fit that exists (2=2=(5-4)).
We would also end up in a 5/2 fit in our precision system; so no edge has been lost here.

# Invitational hands

The rules change slightly with invitational strength. When holding a 6 card minor; we need to still attempt to find our major fit.

When the fit does not exist; we

This is strong and forcing. 

*Only* hands with a self-sufficient suit will respond anything other than 1\ :heart-suit:`H`.

General notes on 1M:
--------------------

Opener's hand is limited, so our raise structure is a bit different from
normal 2/1 systems.
