Opening Bids

We open all 11 counts; and many good 10s, frequently upgrading on shape.

Preempting style is very light in 3rd seat; sound in 1st/2nd red and light 1st/2nd white.

Responding to a 1\ :club-suit:`C` opening:

The first priority of responder is to let opener know if we are in a game
force or not.

.. _Responding to 1D:

---------------------------------------------
Responding to a 1\ :diamond-suit:`D` opening:
---------------------------------------------

Generally, we treat opener's hand as 11-13 balanced unless otherwise told.

Important note: Reverses are alertable, and *non-forcing*, showing only
extreme shape. Care should be taken when reversing if responder has a
potentially weak hand.

--------------------
General notes on 1M:
--------------------

Opener's hand is limited, so our raise structure is a bit different from
normal 2/1 systems.

Important note: Reverses are alertable, and *non-forcing*, showing only
extreme shape. Care should be taken when reversing if responder has a
potentially weak  hand (especially after forcing 1NT).

In competition (except after double), 3M is strictly weak, and
we re-purpose the bid immediately before as a mixed raise.

In addition, new suits at the two level are negative.

(**EVENTUALLY**) After a double, we play a basic transfer system:

Responding to a 1NT opening:

14-16 HCP; Balanced.

Frequently has a 5 card major, 6 card minor, often contains singleton honor, or two doubletons.

.. _Responding to 2C:

------------------------------------------
Responding to a 2\ :club-suit:`C` opening:
------------------------------------------

Things are fairly artificial here; due to the lack of space. Often times;
responder will raise \ :club-suit:`C` preemptively instead of showing a 5-card major
with a sub-invite hand.

.. _Responding to Namyats:

--------------------------------
Responding to a Namyats opening:
--------------------------------

The Namyats bids are somewhat awkward in the system.

As our 1\ :club-suit:`C` bid *promises* 16+ HCP; we are not allowed to
(in Basic/Basic+ games) put hands that evaluate highly
on shape into that bid.

Thus; they get thrown into these bids instead.

Generally; we say 8+; (may occasionally be 7 with a *very* strong suit).
Must contain at least two outside controls (void/aces/kings).

Usually has at least 2 of top 3 honors in the major, and is a
hand we cannot risk passing in 1\ :heart-suit:`H`/\ :spade-suit:`S`.

(Otherwise; 1\ :heart-suit:`H` - ?? - 4\ :heart-suit:`H` is a much more reasonable sequence).

As this bid focuses on very shapely hands; the conventions cooked up
here are about ensuring that we can find slam if partner has the *exact*
freak hand we need to make.

Note that these bids are **TRUMP SETTING**.

There is **no** way to sign off in another suit than the preempted one
(aside from 6NT/7NT signoff). Every new suit is *always* forcing,
or an alternate slam offering.
