        path: major_overcall.yaml
        descripton: |
            Our major overcall style is fairly standard, but slightly wider ranging than 'standard'.
            We prefer doubling with any hand that has a 1-card difference between the two major suits,
            and generally prefer only power doubling with 20+ hands.

            Note that our only forcing major overcalls are our *jump* power double overcalls.

    - name: 1NT Opening
      path: 1nt_opening.yaml
      description: |
        This is 14 to 16 balanced in most seats, and 15 to bad 17 in 3rd vulnerable and 4th seat.

        Our current style is to treat *any* 5-4-2-2 hand in the point range as a 1NT opener, even 5=4=2=2 hands.

        Better minor lebonsohl is turned on for any 2-level interference.

    - name: 1D Opening
      path: 1d_opening.yaml
      description: |
        This is our catch all bid for hands which have at least 2 diamonds, and no 5 card major (or have diamonds > major).

        Should be announced as 'could be 2'.

    - name: 1D in competition
      path: 1d_competition.yaml
      description: |
        Due to the ambiguous nature of the 1D opening, things are fairly artificial here.

        Lots of minor preference asking bids (and very few natrual 2NT calls), transfers, and obstructive bids due to the nature of the limited opener.

        Certain negative free bid sequences should likely be alerted, such as 1 D - 2 C - X, as some pairs may not expect a single game-forcing 5 card major behind the double.
