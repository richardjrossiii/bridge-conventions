    1H/2C: At least 9 cards in the minors. (1=3)=(5-4) is also included in this rebid.
    1S/2C: At least 8 cards in the minors. 1=4=4=4, (1=3)=(5-4), 1=4=(5-3) hands are also included in this rebid.

        4+ $M, forcing one round.

        Occasionally, responder will be obligated to bid 1 $M on a 3 card fragment with short diamonds and no strength.
        We considered this psych, and the system has no psychic control to determine that this has happened.

        Opener *must* always consider responder to have a 4 card suit when making their call, and may not assume a psych has happened.

      1S: 4+ S, non-forcing. Our style is to never bypass a 4 card spade suit on the way to 1NT.
