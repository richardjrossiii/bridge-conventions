        4+ $M, forcing one round.

        Occasionally, responder will be obligated to bid 1 $M on a 3 card fragment with short diamonds and no strength.
        We considered this psych, and the system has no psychic control to determine that this has happened.

        Opener *must* always consider responder to have a 4 card suit when making their call, and may not assume a psych has happened.

      1S: 4+ S, non-forcing. Our style is to never bypass a 4 card spade suit on the way to 1NT.
      1NT: 10-13 HCP, balanced.
      2D: 6+ D
      2H!: 6+ D, 5+ H, non-forcing reverse.
      2S!: 6+ D, 5+ S, non-forcing reverse.
      2M: 4 $M, 10-15 HCP.
      2NT: 6+ D, 4 $M
      3C: 6+ D, 5+ C
      3M: 5+ $M, implies 6+ D.

    1NT: 8-11 HCP, to play.
