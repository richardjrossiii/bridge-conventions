      We open all 11 counts; and many good 10s, frequently upgrading on shape.

      Main features of the system: 

      Preempting style is very light in 3rd seat; sound in 1st/2nd red and light 1st/2nd white.

    title: "Responding to a 1!C opening:"
    anchor: Responding to 1C
    contents: |
      Welcome to the thunderdome. 

      1!C can generally be considered a 'catch all' bid in the system; designed for hands that have:
        - Are 11-13 HCP; balanced
        - Have no 5 card major
        - Have a minor as a primary suit

      Because so many hand shapes could exist here; any intermediate hand with 5+ !C and 5+ !D will bid 2!C; instead. 
      This makes a lot of our relay sequences later much more trivial.

      It's best to treat 1!C as semiforcing. As no *extremely* strong hands exist behind this bid; it can often be correct to pass with a weak hand and good tolerance (4+) for clubs.

      Be aware that partner may still have a very strong two-suited hand; below the 1D threshold.

      Responders goals change slightly depending on whether we are at MPs or IMPs. But in general:

      Weak Hands
      ----------

      Weak hands with a 6 card suit should nearly always attempt to follow their drop sequence - even if they have another side 4 card suit:
        - !C: 1!C - P - 1!S - 1NT - 2!C
        - !D: 1!C - P - 1!S - 1NT - 2!C
        - !H: 1!C - P - 1!D - ? - 2!H
        - !S: 1!C - P - 1!H - ? - 2!S

      In general; hands with a 6 card suit should not attempt to play at the one level (even in clubs - partner may give you a response that significantly improves your hand).

      Weak hands with a single 5 card suit often have a tougher decision to make. 

      When that 5 card suit is a major; transfering to it *nearly always* gets us to the correct par-score. 

      With a 5 card minor and no other mitigating factors; generally trying to drop partner in 1NT is the correct call, as we don't have the space to determine partners minor distribution (they can still have a void in clubs).

      Weak hands with a single 4 card major should strongly consider passing partner in 1!H/!S if the opportunity arises.

      With equal length in the majors; hands start by transfering to hearts. 

      If partner responds 1!H; we can ask for spade support as well by bidding 1!S (forcing 1 round). From there; we generally have a good grasp on the correct place to land the contract. 

      When opener responds 1NT; we comfortably pass with 4/4; and with 5/5 we now have the confidence to safely bid 2!S (non forcing), as there is precisely one shape with a 2 card spade fit that exists (2=2=(5-4)).
      We would also end up in a 5/2 fit in our precision system; so no edge has been lost here.

      # Invitational hands
     
      The rules change slightly with invitational strength. When holding a 6 card minor; we need to still attempt to find our major fit.

      When the fit does not exist; we

      This is strong and forcing. 

      *Only* hands with a self-sufficient suit will respond anything other than 1!H.
