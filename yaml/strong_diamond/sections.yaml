        descripton: |
            Our major overcall style is fairly standard, but slightly wider ranging than 'standard'.
            We prefer doubling with any hand that has a 1-card difference between the two major suits,
            and generally prefer only power doubling with 20+ hands.

            Note that our only forcing major overcalls are our *jump* power double overcalls.

        This is 14 to 16 balanced in most seats, and 15 to bad 17 in 3rd vulnerable and 4th seat.

        Can be 2254 or (42)(52).

        Better minor lebonsohl is turned on for any 2-level interference.

        Flanery. 5H, 4S 10-15 HCP. Note that it is not legal to upgrade a 9HCP hand into the flanery opener, due to this bid being artificial.
