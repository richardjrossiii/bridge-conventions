                Generally, these are hands that 'would accept some game try', 
                though depending on vulnerability this may also include weaker
                hands that want to quickly block the auction.

            3m!|3H!: Game try, short in  $0.
            3M!: Reverse trump suit quality game try. Opener likely has 6+ $M, and is looking for outside values with a semi-balanced hand.
