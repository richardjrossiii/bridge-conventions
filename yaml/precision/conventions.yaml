    title: Opening Bids
    anchor: Opening
    contents: |
      We open all 11 counts; and many good 10s, frequently upgrading on shape.

      Preempting style is very light in 3rd seat; sound in 1st/2nd red and light 1st/2nd white.

      The first priority of responder is to let opener know if we are in a game
      force or not.

    title: "Responding to a 1!D opening:"
    anchor: Responding to 1D
    contents: |
      Generally, we treat opener's hand as 11-13 balanced unless otherwise told.

      Important note: Reverses are alertable, and *non-forcing*, showing only
      extreme shape. Care should be taken when reversing if responder has a
      potentially weak hand.

    title: "General notes on 1M:"
    contents: |
      Opener's hand is limited, so our raise structure is a bit different from
      normal 2/1 systems.

      Important note: Reverses are alertable, and *non-forcing*, showing only
      extreme shape. Care should be taken when reversing if responder has a
      potentially weak  hand (especially after forcing 1NT).

      In competition (except after double), 3M is strictly weak, and
      we re-purpose the bid immediately before as a mixed raise.

      In addition, new suits at the two level are negative.

      (**EVENTUALLY**) After a double, we play a basic transfer system:

      14-16 HCP; Balanced.

      Frequently has a 5 card major, 6 card minor, often contains singleton honor, or two doubletons.

    title: "Responding to a 2!C opening:"
    anchor: Responding to 2C
    contents: |
      Things are fairly artificial here; due to the lack of space. Often times;
      responder will raise !C preemptively instead of showing a 5-card major
      with a sub-invite hand.

    title: "Responding to a Namyats opening:"
    anchor: Responding to Namyats
    contents: |
      The Namyats bids are somewhat awkward in the system.

      As our 1!C bid *promises* 16+ HCP; we are not allowed to
      (in Basic/Basic+ games) put hands that evaluate highly
      on shape into that bid.

      Thus; they get thrown into these bids instead.

      Generally; we say 8+; (may occasionally be 7 with a *very* strong suit).
      Must contain at least two outside controls (void/aces/kings).

      Usually has at least 2 of top 3 honors in the major, and is a
      hand we cannot risk passing in 1!H/!S.

      (Otherwise; 1!H - ?? - 4!H is a much more reasonable sequence).

      As this bid focuses on very shapely hands; the conventions cooked up
      here are about ensuring that we can find slam if partner has the *exact*
      freak hand we need to make.

      Note that these bids are **TRUMP SETTING**.

      There is **no** way to sign off in another suit than the preempted one
      (aside from 6NT/7NT signoff). Every new suit is *always* forcing,
      or an alternate slam offering.
