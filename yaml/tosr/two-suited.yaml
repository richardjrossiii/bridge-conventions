  ~3!C~ [Even Short]: | 
    **{suits:primary_suit 5, secondary_suit 4, middle_suit 2, short_suit 2}** or
    **{suits:primary_suit 7, secondary_suit 4, middle_suit 1, short_suit 1}**.

    Asker always assumes the first shape; and teller responds 4!C to any further calls to clarify they had the 'swan' hand.

    NOTE: This means 4!C is skipped in the normal control count sequences.
